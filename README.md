# puller

puller is a tiny C program to pull changes from several Git repositories at one time.

To compile puller, clone this repository, and run `make`. puller's executable will be compiled to the repository's root directory. It is recommended to add puller to your PATH variable.

To use puller, simply execute:

```shell
puller <directory1...directory2>
```

You can add as many repository directories as you'd like, each separated by a space.

puller is licensed under the MIT license; more information can be found in the LICENSE file at the root of the repository directory.
